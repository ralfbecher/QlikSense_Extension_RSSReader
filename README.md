Qlik Sense Extensions RSS Reader
================================

*RSS is dead, long live RSS!*

This simple extension pulls data from an RSS feed (in XML format) and renders it as a list. You can use the style sheet to adjust the layout to meet your taste.

Since most RSS sites will give you a CORS error in the browser, you will need a proxy in between. An example proxy can be found here:

But, don't use this in production!
